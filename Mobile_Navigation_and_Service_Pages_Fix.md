# Mobile Navigation and Service Pages Fix Documentation

## Overview
Fixed mobile navigation issues and created all missing service pages for the Global Auto Repair website to provide complete functionality across all devices and services.

## Mobile Navigation Fixes

### Issue Identified
- Mobile burger menu navigation tabs were not properly scrolling to sections
- Navigation items were not closing the mobile menu after selection
- Timing issues with smooth scrolling on mobile devices

### Solution Implemented
Updated the `handleNavClick` function in `components/Header.tsx`:

```typescript
const handleNavClick = (href: string) => {
  setIsMenuOpen(false)
  
  if (href.startsWith('#')) {
    // Small delay to allow menu to close first
    setTimeout(() => {
      const element = document.querySelector(href)
      if (element) {
        element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' })
      }
    }, 100)
  } else {
    // For external links, navigate immediately
    window.location.href = href
  }
}
```

### Key Improvements
1. **Menu Closure**: Mobile menu now closes immediately when any navigation item is clicked
2. **Timing Fix**: Added 100ms delay to allow menu animation to complete before scrolling
3. **Scroll Behavior**: Enhanced smooth scrolling with `block: 'start'` for better positioning
4. **External Links**: Proper handling for service page navigation vs anchor scrolling
